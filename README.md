# Project 10: React Around the U.S.!

We are now learning how to use React! It is so exciting! I especially enjoy the ability to use hooks for functional programming.

In this sprint we learned: 

* JSX syntax

* Create React App

* useState() and useEffect()

* Hooks!! (My personal favorite)

* React dev tools

I am super excited to learn more of what React can do! 

# Proejct 11: Advanced React

In Project 11 we finished re-creating the site in React by setting up all of our form functionality.

We learned about:

* React Router

* Lifting state and global state

* context and Redux

* Forms, refs, pure components

* Whiteboard interview training

It was a lot of fun getting the rest of the site functionality set up in React.
